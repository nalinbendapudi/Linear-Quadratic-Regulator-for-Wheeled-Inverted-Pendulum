 ## Linear Quadratic Regulator for Wheeled Inverted Pendulum (WIP)

This project was done as a part of ROB550 (Robotics Systems Lab) course in University of Michigan

- Formulated state space model of a 2-DOF mobile inverted pendulum by linearizing the Lagrangian dynamics of the system
- Combined balancing LQ regulator, in-plane angle stabilizer and a tracking controller to limit position error
- The WIP participated in several fun competitions like drag race and traversing a zig-zag track
